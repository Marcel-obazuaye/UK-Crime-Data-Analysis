## UK Crime Data Analysis

This project analyses UK crime data to evaluate three commonly cited claims:

- Burglary crime in the UK is continuously increasing  
- Liverpool experiences more firearm incidents per capita than any other UK area  
- Firearm-related crimes are closely associated with drug offences  

The analysis adopts the perspective of an insurance company assessing crime-related risk and regional variation, using transparent and data-driven methods.

### Approach
A scalable analytics pipeline was implemented using **Apache Spark** on a cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. UK crime data was filtered to relevant offence categories and combined with population statistics to enable per-capita comparisons.

The project applies:
- Temporal trend analysis  
- Regional comparisons  
- Correlation-based statistical techniques  
- Targeted data visualisations  

Methodological assumptions and limitations are explicitly considered when interpreting results.

### Tools & Technologies
- Apache Spark  
- Cloud IaaS  
- Python

### Output
- Interactive visualisations
- Empirical evaluation of crime-related claims
- Insights relevant to risk assessment and insurance analysis
